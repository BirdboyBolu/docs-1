== Introduction

When sharing files, security is a key aspect. The ownCloud {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/files_antivirus[Anti-Virus] extension helps by protecting against malicious software like trojans or viruses. It forwards files that are being uploaded to the ownCloud server to a  malware scanning engine before they are written to the storage. When a file is recognized as malicious, it can be logged and prevented from being uploaded to the server to ensure that files in ownCloud are free of malware. More sophisticated rules may be specified as admin in the ownCloud Webinterface menu:Admin[Settings > Security].

Out of the box, the ownCloud Anti-Virus extension works with {clamav-url}[Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)] as the directly supported virus scanner. It detects all forms of malware including trojans, viruses and worms and scans compressed files, executables, image files, PDF, as well as many other file types. The ownCloud Anti-Virus application relies on the underlying ClamAV virus scanning engine, to which the admin points ownCloud when configuring the application. The ClamAV virus definitions need to be kept up to date in order to provide effective protection.

Starting with Anti-Virus version 1.0.0, the app also offers an ICAP integration for Enterprise installations. Admins can integrate their favorite enterprise-grade Antivirus Scanners through the open standard {icap-url}[Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP)]. With this set up, ownCloud can delegate the scanning of uploaded files to another machine, the ICAP server. The ICAP server then checks them and either greenlights them or, if malicious code is found, treats the offending file(s) as specified in the settings and notifies the ownCloud server. ownCloud can then act accordingly and based on the settings made reject the upload. Offloading the anti-virus scans to another dedicated server can greatly improve performance compared to running the ClamAV virus scanner on the same machine as ownCloud.

== ClamAV

Feature List:

* Operates on all major operating systems, including _Windows_, _Linux_, and _macOS_.
* Detects all forms of malware including _Trojan horses_, _viruses_, and _worms_.
* Scans _compressed files_, _executables_, _image files_, _Flash_, _PDF_, as well as many others.

What's more, ClamAV's Freshclam daemon automatically updates its malware signature database at scheduled intervals. 

=== Installing ClamAV

Install ClamAV on Ubuntu with the following command:

[source,console]
----
sudo apt install clamav clamav-daemon
----

This automatically creates the default configuration files and launches the `clamd` and `freshclam` daemons.


==== Enabling and Running ClamAV

Enable the `clamd` service file and start `clamd`. 

[source,console]
----
sudo systemctl enable clamav-daemon.service
sudo systemctl start clamav-daemon.service
----

When successful, output similar to the following renders to the console:

[source,console]
----
Synchronizing state of clamav-daemon.service with SysV service script \
with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable clamav-daemon
----

==== ClamAV Virus Database Updates

First we have to ensure the process is currently not running. Gently end the freshclam process with this command:

[source,console]
----
sudo pkill -15 -x freshclam
----

Then we manually start the updating process. Start the refresh process again with this command:

[source,console]
----
sudo freshclam
----

Automate the update process with this cron entry for example.

[source,console]
----
# m   h  dom mon dow  command
47  *  *  *  *  /usr/bin/freshclam --quiet
----

NOTE: Please avoid any multiples of 10, because those are when the ClamAV servers are hit the hardest for updates.

=== Install the ownCloud Anti-Virus App

The Anti-Virus app needs to be installed from the ownCloud Market (it's available in the  _"Security"_ category).

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-app.png[image]

To install the App via occ command, execute:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} market:install files_antivirus
----

=== Configuring ClamAV within ownCloud

IMPORTANT: If the app is enabled but either not configured or incorrectly configured it will *strictly reject all uploads* for the whole instance

ClamAV can be configured in two ways:

. xref:configure-clamav-using-occ[By using the `occ config:app:set` command set.]
. xref:configure-clamav-using-the-antivirus-configuration-panel[By using the Antivirus Configuration panel]

==== Configure ClamAV Using the Antivirus Configuration Panel

Once ClamAV is installed, select menu:Settings[General (Admin)] and, in the "*Log*" section, set btn:[Log level] to "_Everything (fatal issues, errors, warnings, info, debug)_".

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-logging.png[the ownCloud Antivirus configuration panel]

Now, navigate to menu:Settings[Security (Admin)], where you'll find the "**Antivirus Configuration**" panel. 
There, as below, you'll see the configuration options which ownCloud passes to ClamAV.

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-daemon.png[The antivirus configuration panel in ownCloud]

==== Configure ClamAV Using occ

All of the configuration settings for ClamAV are configurable by passing the relevant key and value to the `occ config:app:set files_antivirus` command.
For example:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set \
    files_antivirus av_socket --value="/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl"
----

===== Available Configuration Settings

[cols="32%,43%,15%",options="header"]
|===
|Setting 
|Description 
|Default

|`av_cmd_options`
|Extra command line options (comma-separated) to pass to ClamAV.
|

|`av_host`
|The hostname or IP address of the Antivirus server.
|

|`av_infected_action`

It can be set to one of `only_log` and `delete`.
|`only_log`

|`av_max_file_size`
|The maximum file size limit; `-1` means no limit.
|`-1`

|`av_mode`

|`/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl`

|`av_stream_max_length`
|The maximum stream length that ClamAV will accept.
|`26214400`
|===

==== Mode Configuration

ClamAV runs in one of three modes: 

* xref:daemon-socket[Daemon (Socket)]
* xref:daemon[Daemon]
* xref:executable[Executable]

===== Daemon (Socket)

In this mode, ClamAV runs in the background on the same server as the ownCloud installation, or the socket can be made available via a share mount.
When there is no activity, `clamd` places a minimal load on your system. 
However, if your users upload large volumes of files, you will see high CPU usage. 
Please keep this in mind.

IMPORTANT: You must run `freshclam` at least once for ClamAV to generate the socket.

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-daemon-socket.png[image]

First, set btn:[Mode] to "*Daemon (Socket)*".
ownCloud should detect your `clamd` socket and fill in the "*Socket*" field. 
This is the `LocalSocket` option in `clamd.conf`. 

You can run `ss` to verify it, as in the example below:

[source,console]
----
sudo ss -a | grep -iq clamav && echo "ClamAV is running"
----

[TIP]
====
If you don't have `ss` installed, you may have `netstat` installed. 
If so, you can run the following to check if ClamAV is running:
 
[source,console]
----
netstat -a | grep -q clam && echo "ClamAV is running"
----
====

The `Stream Length` value sets the number of bytes to read in one pass; 10485760 bytes (ten megabytes) is the default. 
This value should be no larger than the PHP `memory_limit` settings or physical memory if `memory_limit` is set to -1 (no limit).

`When infected files were found during a background scan` gives you the choice of either:

* Logging any alerts without deleting the files 
* Immediately deleting infected files

====== Daemon

In this mode, ClamAV runs on a different server. 
This is a good option for ownCloud servers with high volumes of file uploads. 

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-daemon.png[image]

First, set btn:[Mode] to "*Daemon*".
Then, you need to set btn:[Host] to the hostname or IP address of the remote server running ClamAV, and set btn:[Port] to the server's port number.

TIP: The port number is the value of `TCPSocket` in `/etc/clamav/clamd.conf`.

===== Executable

In this mode, ClamAV runs on the same server as the ownCloud installation, with the `clamscan` command running only when a file is uploaded. 

TIP: `clamscan` is slow and not always reliable for on-demand usage; it is better to use one of the daemon modes.

image:apps/files_antivirus/antivirus-executable.png[image]

First, set btn:[Mode] to "*Executable*".
Then, set btn:[Path to clamscan] to the path to `clamscan`, which is the interactive ClamAV scanning command, on your server.
ownCloud should automatically find it.
However, if it doesn't, run `which clamscan` to find the command's path.

When you are satisfied with how ClamAV is operating, you might want to go back and change all of your logging to less verbose levels.

==== Configuration Warnings

The Antivirus App shows one of three warnings if it is misconfigured or ClamAV is not available. 
You can see an example of all three below.

image:configuration/server/anti-virus-message-host-connection-problem.png[Configuration error message: 'Antivirus app is misconfigured or antivirus inaccessible. Could not connect to host 'localhost' on port 999'.]

image:configuration/server/anti-virus-message-misconfiguration-problem.png[Configuration error message: 'Antivirus app is misconfigured or antivirus inaccessible. The antivirus executable could not be found at path '/usr/bin/clamsfcan''.]

image:configuration/server/anti-virus-message-socket-connection-problem.png[Configuration error message: 'Antivirus app is misconfigured or antivirus inaccessible. Could not connect to socket ´/var/run/clamav/cslamd-socket´: No such file or directory (code 2)'.]

==== What To Do With Infected Files Found During Scans

During an upload these actions are taken:

* The upload is blocked.
* The event is logged in the owncloud server log.
* The event is reported and/or logged by the client / Web UI.

During a background scan the app can take one of two actions:

* **Log Only** Log the event.
* **Delete file**: Delete the detected file.

Set btn:[When infected files were found during a background scan] to the value that suits your needs.

==== Rule Configuration

ownCloud provides the ability to customize how it reacts to the response given by an antivirus scan. 
To do so, under menu:Admin[Security (Admin)] click btn:[Advanced], which you can see in the screenshot below, you can view and change the existing rules. 
You can also add new ones.

image:configuration/server/anti-virus-configuration-rules.png[image]

Rules can match on either an exit status (e.g., 0, 1, or 40) or a pattern in the string returned from ClamAV (e.g., `/.*: (.*) FOUND$/`).

Here are some points to bear in mind about rules:

* Scanner exit status rules are used to handle errors when ClamAV is run in CLI mode, while
* Scanner output rules are used in daemon/socket mode.
* Daemon output is parsed by regexp.
* In case there are no matching rules, the status is: `Unknown`, and a warning will be logged.

===== Default Ruleset

The default rule set for ClamAV is populated automatically with the following rules:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
| Exit Status or Signature | Description | Marks File As
| 0 | | Clean
| 1 | | Infected
| 40 | Unknown option passed | Unchecked
| 50 | Database initialization error | Unchecked
| 52 | Not supported file type | Unchecked
| 53 | Can't open directory | Unchecked
| 54 | Can't open file | Unchecked
| 55 | Error reading file | Unchecked
| 56 | Can't stat input file | Unchecked
| 57 | Can't get absolute path name of current working directory
| Unchecked
| 58 | I/O error | Unchecked
| 62 | Can't initialize logger | Unchecked
| 63 | Can't create temporary files/directories | Unchecked
| 64 | Can't write to temporary directory | Unchecked
| 70 | Can't allocate memory (calloc) | Unchecked
| 71 | Can't allocate memory (malloc) | Unchecked
| `/.*: OK$/` | | Clean
| `/.*: (.*) FOUND$/` | | Infected
| `/.*: (.*) ERROR$/` | | Unchecked
|===

The rules are always checked in the following order:

. Infected
. Error
. Clean

In case there are no matching rules, the status would be `Unknown` and a warning would be logged.

===== Update An Existing Rule

To match on an exit status, change the "**Match by**" dropdown list to "**Scanner exit status**" and in the "**Scanner exit status or signature to search**" field, add the status code to match on.

To match on the scanner's output, change the "**Match by**" dropdown list to "**Scanner output**" and in the "**Scanner exit status or signature to search**" field, add the regular expression to match against the scanner's output.

Then, while not mandatory, add a description of what the status or scan output means. 
After that, set what ownCloud should do when the exit status or regular expression you set matches the value returned by ClamAV. 
To do so change the value of the dropdown in the "**Mark as**" column.

The dropdown supports the following three options:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
| Option    | Description
| Clean     | The file is clean and contains no viruses
| Infected  | The file contains a virus
| Unchecked | No action should be taken
|===

With all these changes made, click the btn:[check mark] on the left-hand side of the "**Match by**" column, to confirm the change to the rule.

===== Add A New Rule

To add a new rule, click the button marked btn:[Add a rule] at the bottom left of the rules table. 
Then follow the process outlined in xref:default-ruleset[Update An Existing Rule].

===== Delete An Existing Rule

To delete an existing rule, click the btn:[rubbish bin] icon on the far right-hand side of the rule that you want to delete.

==== How ClamAV Works With ownCloud

ownCloud integrates with antivirus tools by connecting to them via:

* A URL and port
* A socket
* Streaming the data from the command-line via a pipe with a configured executable

In the case of ClamAV, ownCloud's Antivirus extension sends files as streams to a ClamAV service (which can be on the same ownCloud server or another server within the same network) which in turn scans them and returns a result to stdout.

NOTE: Individual chunks are *not* scanned. 
The whole file is scanned when it is moved to the final location.

The information is then parsed, or an exit code is evaluated if no result is available to determine the response from the scan. 
Based on ownCloud's evaluation of the response (or exit code) an appropriate action is then taken, such as recording a log message or deleting the file.

NOTE: Scanner exit status rules are used to handle errors when ClamAV is run in CLI mode. 
Scanner output rules are used in daemon/socket mode.

=== Things To Note

. Files are checked when they are uploaded or updated (whether because they were edited or saved) but _not_ when they are downloaded.
. ownCloud doesn't support a cache of previously scanned files.
. If the app is either not configured or is misconfigured, then it rejects file uploads.
. If ClamAV is unavailable, then the app rejects file uploads.
. A file size limit applies both to background jobs and to file uploads.
. After installing ClamAV and the related tools, you will have two configuration files: `/etc/freshclam.conf` and `/etc/clamd.d/scan.conf`. 
. We recommend that you enable verbose logging in both `clamd.conf` and `freshclam.conf` until you get any kinks with your ClamAV installation worked out


== ICAP

{icap-url}[ICAP] is an open standard supported by many antivirus products. With the release of the _Anti-Virus_ app 1.0.0, other virus scanners beside ClamAV can be used via ICAP if you are running it on an ownCloud Enterprise Edition. Currently the only tested and supported virus scanners, besides ClamAV, are _Kaspersky ScanEngine_ and _McAfee Antivirus_ although far more products might simply work.

=== Installation

- Install the {oc-marketplace-url}/apps/files_antivirus[Anti-Virus app] from the ownCloud marketplace. Alternatively, use this occ command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} market:install files_antivirus
----

- Enable the app as admin in ownCloud under menu:[Settings > Apps] in the category `Security` or with the following occ command:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} app:enable files_antivirus
----


=== General Configuration

ICAP can be configured via the Web interface as admin user or via xref:occ_command.adoc[occ commands].

==== Antivirus Configuration Panel

Log in to ownCloud as admin via the Web interface and go to menu:Admin[Settings > Security] and you'll see the Antivirus Configuration dialog.

image:configuration/server/anti-virus-panel.png[Security Settings, width:80%]

Enter the desired values:

`Mode`::
Set to `Daemon (ICAP)`.

`Host`::
Enter the IP addess of your ICAP server.

`Port`::
Specify the port number (default 1344).

`Stream Length`::
Set the length of streams sent to the ICAP server in bytes.

`File size limit`::
If you want to limit the file size, enter the maximum value in bytes. Default is no limit (-1).

`ICAP request service`::
Select the antivirus software you want to use: avscan for ClamAV, req for Kaspersky ScanEngine or `wwreqmod` for McAfee.

`ICAP response header holding the virus information`::
Use `X-Infection-Found` for ClamAV (avscan) and `X-Virus-ID` for KAV (req). McAfee doesn't offer response headers.

`When infected files were found during a background scan`::
Specify what to do with the flagged files. Possible values: `Delete file` or `Only log`.

CAUTION: Do not change the rules hidden under btn:[Advanced] unless you know exactly what you're doing. The defaults should work best. If you have special requirements, contact us at consulting@owncloud.com.


==== Command-line Configuration

On the command line, change into your ownCloud directory, usually `/var/www/owncloud`, and enter the following occ commands:

* To set the IP address of your anti-virus server:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
av_host --value="172.17.0.3"
----

* Specify the port of the anti-virus server:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
av_port --value="1344"
----

* Set the mode to ICAP:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
av_mode --value="icap"
----

NOTE: The setting `icap` triggers a grace period of 24 hours if you don't have an Enterprise license but want to test ICAP.

* Specify what do do with the offending file:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
av_infected_action --value="delete"
----

Possible values are 'delete' and 'only_log'.


=== Run with c-icap/ClamAV

c-icap has a built in ClamAV module. For more information see: {c-icap-url}[c-icap on sourceforge].

* The IP address needs to be set in the general configuration above.

* Now set the mode to 'c-icap with ClamAV':

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} occ config:app:set files_antivirus \
av_request_service --value="avscan"
----

* Next, set the response header:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
av_response_header --value="X-Infection-Found"
----


### Run with Kaspersky Anti-Virus (KAV)

* Install Kaspersky ScanEngine for Kubernetes.7z and follow the instructions.

* Set KAV as virus scanner with the value `req`:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
av_request_service --value="req"
----

* Set the respective response header:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} config:app:set files_antivirus \
av_response_header --value="X-Virus-ID"
----

NOTE: Older versions of KAV did not send back the virus/infection name in an ICAP header. Version 2.0.0 of KAV allows you to configure the header to transport the virus. By default no header is sent.


=== Run with McAfee

// Which product exactly?

Install the McAfee virus scanner.

* The IP address needs to be set in the general configuration above.

* Now set the mode to `wwreqmod` to use McAfee:

[source,console,subs="attributes+"]
----
{occ-command-example-prefix} occ config:app:set files_antivirus \
av_request_service --value="wwreqmod"
----

NOTE: McAfee does not offer response headers.
