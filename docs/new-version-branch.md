# Create a New Version Branch for Docs

When doing a new release of ownCloud Server like `10.x`, a new version branch must be created based on `master`. It is necessary to do this in three steps. Please set the new and former version numbers accordingly

**Step 1: This will create and configure the new `10.x` branch properly**

1.  Create a new `10.x` branch based on latest `origin/master`
2.  In `.drone.star` set `latest_version` to `10.x` (on top in section `def main(ctx)`)
3.  In `site.yml` have **only one** branch at `url: https://github.com/owncloud/docs.git`
    and set it to the **former** version of 10.x `10.x-1` ! (in section `content.sources.url.branches`)
4.  In `site.yml` adjust all `-version` keys according the new and former releases
    (in section `asciidoc.attributes`)
5.  In `antora.yml` change the version from `master` to `10.x`
6.  Run a build by entering `yarn antora`. No errors should occur
7.  Commit the changes and push the new `10.x` branch. DO NOT CREATE A PR!

**Step 2: This will configure the master branch properly to use the new `10.x` branch**

8.  Create new `changes_necessary_for_10.x` branch based on latest `origin/master`
9.  In `.drone.star` set `latest_version` to `10.x` (on top in section `def main(ctx)`)
10. In `site.yml` adjust the last **two** branches at `url: https://github.com/owncloud/docs.git` accordingly
    (in section `content.sources.url.branches`)
11. In `site.yml` adjust all `-version` keys according the new and former releases
    (in section `asciidoc.attributes`)
12. No changes in `antora.yml` but check if the version is set to `master`
13. Run a build by entering `yarn antora`. No errors should occur
14. Commit changes and push it
15. Create a Pull Request. When CI is green, all is done correctly

**Step 3: Protection and Renaming**

16. Go to the settings of the docs repository and change the protection of the branch list so that
    the `10.x` branch gets protected and the `10.x-1` branch is no longer protected.
17. Rename the `10.x-1` branch to `x_archived_10.x-1`
